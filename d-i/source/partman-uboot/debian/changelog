partman-uboot (2.1) karmic; urgency=low

  * mkfs.ext2 with -I 128 and not -b 4096 as this is what Marvell recommends
    to work around a bug in older Uboots.

partman-uboot (1) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Michael Casadevall ]
  * New package partman-uboot based on partman-ext2r0 which adds support
    for the creating a /boot partition as required by our boot system on
    u-boot based systems
  * ext2 filesystem formatted with -b 4096 as per Marvell's instructions

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add explicit subarchitecture checks to a few scripts. This does
    duplicate XB-Subarchitecture in debian/control, but it makes life easier
    for ubiquity.
